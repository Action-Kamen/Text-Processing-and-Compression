# Text-Processing-and-Compression
•Designed a dynamic context-based auto completion system in C++ using Prefix Trie data structure • Applied the KMP Algorithm to enhance efficiency in recommendation generation based on user text history • Implemented the Huffman coding and LZ77 algorithm to perform lossless compression using back-referencing
